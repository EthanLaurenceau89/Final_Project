# Final_Project
 
 The purpose of this project is to be able to gather insight given Crime Data from San Francisco Police Department from the file: "SFCD_2018.csv". My hopes were to implement the Data Science Techniques so that after viewing my work the SF Police Department will be able to predict how crimes will be resolved given certain parameters such as the date the crime occured, the time it occured, as well as the location. I also wanted the SF Police be able to look at peaks of crime, how it changes over an interval of time, and other analysis that are vivid in the Jupyter Notebook entitled "EthanL_DSFinalProject.ipynb".
 
 I first sought to gain metrics from the crime data. This included looking at the top crimes commited, the number of crimes comitted by weekday, the number crimes commited each month, and how the crimes were resolved. This is explained in more detail in the Jupyter Notebook. The required importing to the notebook from a py file entitled "SFCrimeProjectCode.py". The file contained the python libraries, and functions used to operate over the data.
 
 The Jupyter Notebook also consist of summarizing tables and plots that displayed discovered metrics. This was part of Feature Engineering and Modeling Phase.
 
 Lastly, I then implemented an SVM model in the Jupyter Notebook in order to predict the resolution for a crime based on date, day, time, location, just to be brief. This is given in more detail in the notebook.
 
 My hope was by using the model, the Police Department can predict how a crime will be resolved based on the specified parameters and if resolution is not desired, neccessary action can be taken to get desired resolutions, to ensure justice is served.

I also wanted to supply insight to which days, times, months, locations crimes occur more so that police dept. can take preventative measures.
